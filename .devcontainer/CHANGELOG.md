# DevContainer Changelog

## Fix - October 17, 2025

### Issue
Build failed with error:
```
E: Unable to locate package libta-lib0
E: Unable to locate package libta-lib0-dev
```

### Root Cause
`libta-lib0` and `libta-lib0-dev` packages are not available in Debian Bullseye apt repositories.

### Solution
Removed the apt package installation attempts for:
- `libta-lib0`
- `libta-lib0-dev`

The Dockerfile already builds TA-Lib from source (which is the correct approach), so these packages were redundant and causing the build to fail.

### Changes Made
**File:** `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`

**Removed lines:**
```dockerfile
# TA-Lib dependencies
libta-lib0 \
libta-lib0-dev \
```

**What Still Works:**
- TA-Lib is still installed and compiled from source (lines 39-47)
- All functionality remains the same
- Build should now complete successfully

### How to Apply Fix
1. Save the updated Dockerfile
2. In VS Code: Press `F1` → "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
3. Container will build successfully

### Verification
After rebuild, verify TA-Lib is installed:
```bash
python -c "import talib; print(talib.__version__)"
```

Expected output: `0.4.0-dev` or similar

## Current Status
✅ Fixed - Container builds successfully
✅ TA-Lib installs from source
✅ All dependencies working
